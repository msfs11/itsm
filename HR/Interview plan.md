## Describe the interview plan for candidate
To tell to the candidate how the interview will go:

## General questions about education, experience

# Skills-based questions
TBD by team lead. To assess hard-skills (knowledge of the exact technologies needed for job).

## How to get the answers you need?
Push candidates to give you better information by doing the following:
- Use the S.T.A.R. system: As the candidate answers each question, make sure they describe the Situation, Task, Action, and Result.
- Don’t accept situational responses: When you ask for specific examples, make sure candidates don’t give you situational (hypothetical) information.
- Give them time: Often good answers come after a moment of reflection, so don’t rush candidates or write them off if they don’t answer quickly.
- Follow up: Hone in on a specific piece of missing information in their response to dig deeper into the situation.

# Behavioral questions
Past performance assessement.

Ask a few open-ended “why” questions.
Have the candidate give you concrete examples of times when they demonstrated strengths in your desired skill set?
There is no time for all questions, choose some questions from the list from each section.
